Evolving Mario Levels

Created various Mario levels using a Python program that finds interesting and playable Super Mario Bros. levels through
an evolutionary algorithm. Explored two different encodings of the Mario level, tweaked fitness functions and evolutionary operators in both encodings to produce cool levels. Implement a selection strategy, crossover and mutation operators, fitness
calculations.

Challenges: Understanding genetic algorithms and how they calculate fitness levels and mutate accordingly.

Learned: The basics of genetic algorithms and how they can be used for content generation such as levels in Mario.
